## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Olympic analysts and enthusiasts understand medal distribution better. It provides insights into medal counts categorized by type (gold, silver, bronze), gender, country, and sport. The dashboard helps identify trends in medal performance, highlighting countries excelling in specific sports and the gender distribution of athletes across events.

It also features a historical page that tracks the evolution of medal achievements over different Olympic events, giving a comprehensive view of how countries have progressed or regressed in their medal counts over time. This historical insight allows for a deeper understanding of global sports dominance and the factors contributing to it.

Since the data highlights disparities in medal achievements between countries and genders, the dashboard can help organizations address these gaps. Additionally, the sports breakdown allows countries to focus on their strengths and work towards improving in areas where they lag behind.
